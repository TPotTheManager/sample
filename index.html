        <h1> My Favorite Gposes </h1>
        <p> Once I understood Brio and ktisis i was able to get a better grasp on gposing </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Importing poses made getting started easier </li>
            <li> Getting reshade presents made images look far more crisp </li>
            <li> getting the add-on supported version made integrating presets possibel otehrwise many filters were unavailable and the UI would be distorted </li>
        </ul>
